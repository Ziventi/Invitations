      <h2>Guest List</h2>
      <p>
        It'd make sense for you to check the guest list so you're aware of
        anybody you can tag along with to the event. Always nice to know who's
        coming, right?
      </p>
      <p>
        Tap the following link for the full
        <a href="<%= lists.guest %>" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
          >guest list</a
        >. I appreciate your wisdom and discretion in keeping it to yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please refrain from reminding me of the quantity of guests on the list,
        I'm very well aware. I'll explain why this is the case on the night.

      <h2>Wish List</h2>
      <p>
        I don't receive gifts often so I'm not expectant; you're under no
        obligation to give. But I recognise that some of you are strong, loving
        givers. I'd be honoured to provide an opportunity for you to express
        your love.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tap the following link for my
        <a href="<%= lists.wish %>" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
          >wish list</a
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        To prevent a case where I receive multiple gifts of something I only
        need one of, I ask that you assign yourself to an item if you are
        purchasing off the wish list. Additionally, to make buyers anonymous,
        please use your unique wish list ID which I have assigned to you when
        assigning yourself to an item.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your anonymous wish list ID is:<br />
        <strong class="wlid"><%= guest.wlid %></strong>
